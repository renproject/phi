// This example implements a number consensus algorithm. The aim of the
// algorithm is for a set of players, each with their own internal number, to
// all agree on the maximum number of all the players. They do this by
// communicating with eachother using messages in a connected network. When a
// player decides it knows what the maximum number is, it outputs this number
// and terminates. When all of the players terminate, if they all output the
// same number, and that number was indeed the maximum of the internal numbers,
// the algorithm is considered to have executed correctly. Otherwise, the
// execution was a failure.
